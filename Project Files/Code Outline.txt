Pass in paramaters data
Convert paramaters into a dictionary with string keys, and arrays as values [Value, Uncertainty]

Run minimze function using nelder on input data

If input data does not have uncertainty values for each flux value, calculate it (calcualted single value for whole data set)

Remove outlier flux values based on initial fit graph (points can dieviate by a given percetnage from the expected outlup equation)

Run minimize function on data (now with error values if they were missing, and having outliers removed) using LBM and using the output pramaters from the nelder fit as it's initaial values (orignal input priors are still applied)
This step is performed because nelder does not calucalte uncertainty values of each parameter, and LBM converges too quickly to a bad fit. NOTE: Check if running already optimized paramters through LBM actually results in accurate uncertainty values.

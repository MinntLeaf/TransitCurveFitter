How to calculate ChiSqr with errors, confirm Chisqr formula is corect

Fitting Methods:
	Currently using "Nelder-Mead"
	Because:
		Allows for single output value to minimize (as opposed to array)
		Least sqr is likely a better option, but requires an array of output points
		It then performs chisqr calculations on the ouput values and the input values
		This means we can't directly modify the Chisqr value (EX: To include priors), which is a problem
	Thoughts:
		Being able to modify the final Chisqr like we are right now is helpfull as it allows me to better understand the process since I have direct control over it
		And it allows me to implement priors
		However, it is likely worse at producing a high precision fitted curve, because condensing all the infomration from the graph into a single value throws out a lot of infomration that is usfull for the fitting algorythym
		With the current system it is dificuilt for the system to glean information as it randomly picks values, snce it is only given a final number that is only minorly affected by the value of any given point

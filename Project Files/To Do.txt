confirm that chi-squared calculation is giving appropriate values
confirm that gaussian priors work correctly
provide ability to work even if measurement uncertainties aren't given (probably just perform an initial, unweighted fit, then set the uncertainties to something like the sqrt of the residuals)
perform decent outlier rejection (that is, the algorithm should be able to recognize if a few data points are wildly discrepant and just ignore them)
Finally: wrap everything up into a single module or code package -- so that someone can just say "import blah" and then "results = blah.fitTransit(param1, param2, ...)"

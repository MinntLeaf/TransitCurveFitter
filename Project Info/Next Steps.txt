sandard deviation(data-model)
Find how lmfit implements weights (1/weight or 1/weight^2) ?
Implement priors as penalty values if x^2 deviates from known value

All uncertainties should be the same, they represent the uncertainty of the data set, not the uncertainty of a single point.
Look into basian, gausian curves, probability distribution to better understand it.
